title: 12 November, Before Diwali
---

I’m gonna write my weekly update now,
So in this following week of Diwali, may all wishes of all people and entities in the universe became true. **Happy Diwali to y'all!**

_I’m on my 12th day of NoFap and I’m feeling all that rush in my body as always, I don’t feel lethargic these days. It’s like getting high without any external force. Although it is harder than taking a pill but trust me it’s worth it. You can really feel the beat of music like you’re not typing you’re just drumming!!!!_

I also started mewing a few days ago, also I’m not binge eating nowadays as I was eating before. So my facial posture is also becoming a good man, I don’t want to praise myself but I’m being attracted to myself. Hope I will not get an erection from me.

I know that I’m really talking open-minded but this is the real me who spends all time with me and didn’t get bored due to me.

My Atya is coming tomorrow so it’s gonna be a lot of fun from tomorrow and I’m ready for it. I’m not gonna long posts now but I will for sure. Thanks.
